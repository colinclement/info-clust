Information-Theoretic Clustering
================================

This is a python module implementing a method for using a pairwise similarity measure to
cluster data. This method is a probabilistic clustering, that is, given a similarity
between items $i$ and $j$ $s(i,j)$ and a number of clusters to use, this method will
return $P(i, c)$, the probability that you would find item $i$ in cluster $c$.
